# ExcelBudgetAnalysis
In this Project I create two budget forecasts based on two independent assumptions to give the stakeholder the best Plan that equates to more Profit through the year.

### Plan A
> Includes 10% sales price decrease from November through January and the predicted sales that would arise due to the decrease in price
> More advertising budget allocated to jan and feb

### Plan B
> Sale prices are kept constant through the year
> More advertising budget is allocated for each month
